# Genetic Algorithm exploration

There's a few algorithms that I love, and this is one of them.

## Why?

Genetic Algorithm has a sort of "liveliness" aspect to it, which I think is both super interesting to look at and has so
many applications. Explored this to understand it better and make use of it in later projects.

## Features

- Minimal 3d scene - just a POC.
- Header display generation count and life timer for each generation.

## Installation

- It's just static. Just run it over a server.

## Project Status

Done. Won't go further.
